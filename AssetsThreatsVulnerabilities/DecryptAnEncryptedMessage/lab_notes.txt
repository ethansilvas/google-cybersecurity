cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
    Note: The tr command translates text from one set of characters to another, using a mapping. The first parameter to the tr command represents the input set of characters, and the second represents the output set of characters. Hence, if you provide parameters “abcd” and “pqrs”, and the input string to the tr command is “ac”, the output string will be “pr".
    In this case, the command tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z" translates all the lowercase and uppercase letters in the alphabet back to their original position. The first character set, indicated by "d-za-cD-ZA-C", is translated to the second character set, which is "a-zA-Z".

openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
    openssl command reverses the encryption of the file with a secure symmetric cipher, as indicated by AES-256-CBC
    The -pbkdf2 option is used to add extra security to the key, and -a indicates the desired encoding for the output.
    The -d indicates decrypting, while -in specifies the input file and -out specifies the output file.
    The -k specifies the password, which in this example is ettubrute.

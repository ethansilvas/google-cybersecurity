    "Built-in functions are functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. They help analysts efficiently complete tasks. Python also supports user-defined functions. These are functions that analysts write for their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, patterns in login attempts could reveal suspicious activity. Python functions can help analysts work efficiently with lists of login attempts. Both built-in functions and user-defined functions in Python can help security analysts analyze login attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use built-in functions to work with a list of failed login attempts per month to prepare it for further analysis, and you'll define a function that compares the user's login attempts for the current day to their average number of login attempts."

    "As a security analyst, when you're writing out Python code to automate a certain task, you'll often find yourself needing to reuse the same block of code more than once. This is why functions are important. You can call that function whenever you need the computer to execute those steps. Python not only has built-in functions that have already been defined, but also provides the tools for users to define their own functions. Security analysts often define and call functions in Python to automate series of tasks. \n",

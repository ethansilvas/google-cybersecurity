Note: There is no right and wrong when using apropos in terms of keywords. Think of it as a very focused search. It will only return commands that correspond to keywords you supply. Keep trying if the first returned command does not provide what you need. Also, keep in mind that using the -a option will limit results to only those commands that match all keywords supplied.

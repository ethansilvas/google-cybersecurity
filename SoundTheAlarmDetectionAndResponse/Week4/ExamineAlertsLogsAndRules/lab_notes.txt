cat custom.rules

common actions 
    alert, drop, pass, and reject
        drop also generates an alert but drops the traffic
            only works in IPS mode
        pass allows traffic to pass through the network interface
            can be used to override other rules 
            
            alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
            pass http 172.17.0.77 any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"BAD USER-AGENT";flow:established,to_server;content:!”Mozilla/5.0”; http_user_agent; sid: 12365; rev:1;)
                same rule but will allow the specified IP to allow http traffic from there
        reject does not allow traffic to pass 
            TCP reset packet will be sent 
                will drop matching packet 

                TCP reset tells computers to stop sending messages to each other 

$HOME_NET is a Suricata variable defined in /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

The flow:established,to_server option determines that packets from the client to the server should be matched. (In this instance, a server is defined as the device responding to the initial SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet.)

sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none
    This command starts the Suricata application and processes the sample.pcap file using the rules in the custom.rules file. It returns an output stating how many packets were processed by Suricata.

    The -r sample.pcap option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
    The -S custom.rules option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the custom.rules file.
    The -k none option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less
    displays entries in log files in a readable format

jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
    Note: The jq command above extracts the fields specified in the list in the square brackets from the JSON payload. The fields selected are the timestamp (.timestamp), the flow id (.flow_id), the alert signature or msg (.alert.signature), the protocol (.proto), and the destination IP address (.dest_ip).
